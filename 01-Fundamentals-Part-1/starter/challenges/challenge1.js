1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in
variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you
can even implement both versions)
3. Create a boolean variable 'markHigherBMI'
containing information about whether Mark has a
higher BMI than John.

TEST DATA 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall.
John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
TEST DATA 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall.
John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.
